## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

**Fusion Jokers** is a mod that allows players to combine jokers into special powerful new **Fusion Jokers**!

When you have a fusable joker, pressing on it will show a **"fuse" button**. When you have the correct jokers, and enough money, you can combine the jokers into a powerful **Fusion**!

There are a total of 15 fusions added in the mod!

You can find a list of their abilities, as well as the jokers needed to make them, in this link: https://itayfeder.github.io/Fusion-Jokers/

## ‚¨á How to Download <a name = "how_to_download"></a>

- The mod requires Steamodded. You can see info about how to use it [here](https://github.com/Steamopollys/Steamodded)
- Download the latest release of Fusion Jokers
- Extract the downloaded mod to the Mods folder (at %appdata%/Balatro/Mods)

## ‚ûï Fusion API (For Developers) <a name = "fusion_api"></a>

The mod adds a way for other developers to create their own fusions!

Developers can call the function `FusionJokers.fusions:add_fusion()` to register their own fusion to the game. The function also allows them to determine carried stats between the component jokers and the fusion joker.
